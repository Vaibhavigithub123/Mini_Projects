# Guitar Learning Landing Page

I have created this Guitar Learning Landing Page just to improve my styling and animations skills with the help of GSAP library.
The Guitar Learning Landing Page is a visually appealing and interactive web application designed to attract users to learn how to play the guitar. The application features a video background, smooth animations, and a clean, modern design. This landing page aims to provide an engaging introduction to the guitar learning platform and encourage visitors to join and find the right instructor for them.
