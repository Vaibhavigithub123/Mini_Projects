# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to my simple Tic Tac Toe Game! 
This is a classic implementation of the popular two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## JS concepts to focus on?
- Array methods - Array.fill(), Array.some()
- conditional statement
- operators

## How to play?
- Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O".
- Players take turns clicking on an empty cell in the 3x3 grid.
- The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all nine cells are filled without any player aligning three marks, the game ends in a draw.
